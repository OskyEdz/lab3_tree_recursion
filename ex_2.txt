Exercise 2

main.c run calls to bin_tree_func.c via header bin_tree.h
I created the tree with createLoadTree and loading files provided (with some minor alterations)(load_file.c and load_file.h)

I ran a few different versions of problems from the sorting_problems.tar.gz

Go to test_1 or test_2 in bin_tree_func.c (line 162 and down)
Replace sorting problem and solution with any other file mad with the python script. (no changes this time)
